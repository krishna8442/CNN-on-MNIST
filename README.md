# CNN-on-MNIST

This project is the first step in my journey of Deep learning. 


The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification and accessible from many different sources. In fact, even Tensorflow and Keras allow us to import and download the MNIST dataset directly from their API.
